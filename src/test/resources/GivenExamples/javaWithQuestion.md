# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
by a common name. 
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has
actually been created yet]]. 

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];
- [[US Capital ::: WashingtonDc]]
- [[Texas Capital ::: Austin]]
- [[What is Texas NickName
:::
Lone Star State]]
- [[Who lives in a pineapple under the sea :::
SpongeBob SquarePants]]
- [[What is 4 + 4
::: 8]]

- Data types of the reference and array need to match. 
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not 
here
modifiable once instantiated.]]
